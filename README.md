I spent very long on this, I worked very hard and tried my best on all of the parts, please approve it Mr. Alex, also the code might not work, but i find it very very very difficult to code without the thing I'm making infront of me, but I tried my best, and spent 3+ hours reaserching and typing the code for the firmware.
